# YumCraft

YumCraft is an innovative recipe generation application that leverages AI and machine learning to provide users with personalized cooking experiences. The application tailors recipes based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and also allows users to search for recipes by name. Developed using Flutter for the mobile interface and Flask for the backend, with MongoDB as the database, YumCraft integrates multiple technological components to offer a comprehensive culinary solution.

## Features

- **Personalized Recipes**: Get recipe suggestions based on available ingredients and dietary preferences.
- **Recipe Search**: Search for recipes by name and retrieve detailed information from a robust MongoDB database.
- **Nutritional Information**: Access detailed nutritional information for each recipe.
- **Favorites**: Save favorite recipes for easy access.
- **Ratings and Comments**: Rate recipes and add comments to share feedback with other users.
- **User-Centered Design**: Intuitive and accessible interface based on feedback from potential end-users.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Proactively addresses data privacy, transparency, fair access, and bias in recommendations.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Integrated models to tailor recipes based on user inputs.
